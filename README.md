## About the Project

<p>This is the most recent iteration of my portfolio! This is currently v5. The first three versions of my portfolio never went into production and the v4 production was built using create-react-app and hosted on Github pages. I decided to go for another go at improving on my portfolio to help me learn new technologies and make it "change-friendly". My last portfolio wasn't very templated (which would require a lot of configuration for adding new content), the design was rough around the edges, the code was a mess, and the resizing isn't nearly as fluid as it is at ronmagpantay.com</p>

<br>
<br>

### Improvements:

<ul>
  <li>Major resizing improvements from the previous portfolio iteration.</li>
  <li>Content is served through a CMS (Contentful) or locally which aids in templating my content.</li>
  <li>Page load time, Domain hosting, and plugin friendliness is very efficient in Gatsby</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

## Built With

<ul>
  <li>Gatsby</li>
  <li>Contentful</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p>I decided to build this portfolio with the technologies above due to my expososure to them at my internship @ <a href="www.ritual.com">Ritual</a> , a multivitamin startup based out of Los Angeles, CA. I was amazed with the way content was so templated that non-technical individuals could change content on the website, and page load time was incredibly fast, so I wanted to see if I could create a portfolio that was just as performant and with content that could be easily modified.</p>

<p>I used her website as a mockup and built it from the ground up. There are a lot of key differences between our portfolios, as she utilizes the Stylized Components plugin in Gatsby and hosts her website via Netlify whereas mine is on Gatsby Cloud.</p>
